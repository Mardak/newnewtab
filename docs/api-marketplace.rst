server-to-server API where Marketplace can give some recommendations
for each of the categories. The idea is the newnewtab page will have
this recommendation data and use a special client API for Firefox to
provide user-relevant categories to the page, so that the page can
show, say, one recommendation in the user's top 3 categories with
links to the app as well as the category."
